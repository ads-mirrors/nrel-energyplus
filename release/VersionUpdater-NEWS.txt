Big news!  As of EnergyPLus 25.1.0, the classic IDF Version Updater tool is being deprecated.

A brand-new version updater tool has been developed, and is now packaged up on all platforms.
This new tool was written in Python, and leverages the Python interpreter embedded inside
EnergyPlus.  If you'd like to give it a try, here's how:

# Windows
Just click the IDFVersionUpdater_Python shortcut in the EnergyPlus installation root folder (one folder up from here),
or launch from the Windows start menu (if you installed start menu shortcuts).

# Mac
There is an .app bundle right in the EnergyPlus Applications root folder, just launch from there.  One open you can pin
it to the dock for easy access.

# Linux
Like Windows, there are shortcuts right in the install folder, but it is also available from the new desktop
integration.  After install, press that "Start" button on the keyboard, and pin the EnergyPlus icon to the dock.  From
there, you can right click to access the Python EPLaunch or the Python IDFVersionUpdater.

# Classic Version
The classic updater tool was not working on Ubuntu 24.04, and so it was removed entirely in favor of the Python tool.
The classic updater tool is still included on Windows and Mac, but will be removed in a future version.
