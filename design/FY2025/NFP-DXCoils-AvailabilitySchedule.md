Add Availability Schedule Input Fields to DX Coils
==================================================

**Bereket Nigusse, Florida Solar Energy Center**

 - First draft: March 6, 2025
 - Modified Date: March 20, 2025

## Justification for New Feature ##

Add an availability schedule input field to DX Coil objects that currently lack one. Eleven DX Coils that don’t have an availability schedule were identified, so turning them On or Off when desired is impossible. The availability schedule allows turning the coils On or Off regardless of load. Plans are to add availability schedule input fields to all eleven DX coils identified; however, the implementation scope could be limited depending on the budget.


## E-mail and  Conference Call Conclusions ##

** Put the availability schedule name input field as the second input field for all the seven DX coils **

## Overview ##

EnergyPlus code will be modified to add availability schedule input field to DX coils and adds a logic to turn On or Off depending on the schedule value.

### Current Code ###

(1) Seven DX Coils do not have availability schedule input fields
(2) Table below summarizes the DX Coils missing availability schedule input field

(3) **- This enhancement allows operational flexibility **.

## Approach ##

Adds availability schedule new input field and logic that turns On or Off the DX coils based on the availability schedule value. The steps envisioned for this enhancement include:

*(1) Cleanup get inputs and other functions including CPP check for each of the DX coil modules *

*(2) Change the get input function to JSON format when possible *

*(3) Update IDD; add new input field for each of the DX coils identified *

*(4) Add “Availability Schedule Name” new input field to each of the DX coils identified *

*(5) Implement the availability schedule functionality logic in calc function for each of the DX coils identified *

*(6) Demonstrate the change through example and unit tests *

*(7) Add transition rules for each of the DX coils identified *

*(8) Update the latex reference documentation *


### DX Coils Missing Availability Schedule ###

* IDD change snippet for each of the DX Coils to be modified *

* Adds new input field: "Availability Schedule Name" *

* Update the min-fields number *

## Testing/Validation/Data Source(s): ##

Demonstrate that the availability schedule input field scheduled off duplicates the current results using exact set of inputs. Unit tests will be added to demonstrate the new feature.


## Input Output Reference Documentation ##

Update the "group-heating-and-cooling-coils.tex" file by adding the new input field description for each of the DX coils identified. The following latex content will be added depending on the
DX coil type:

```
\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-16-001}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX heating coil can run during a given time period. 
A schedule value of 0 indicates that the DX heating coil is off for that time period. If the schedule's value is \textgreater{} 0 (usually 1 is used), 
the coil is On duing that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Schedule values must be \textgreater{}= 0 and \textless{}= 1.


\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-16-002}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. 
A schedule value of 0 indicates that the DX cooling coil is off for that time period. If the schedule's value is \textgreater{} 0 (usually 1 is used), 
the coil is On duing that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Schedule values must be \textgreater{}= 0 and \textless{}= 1.


\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-16-003}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX Water Heating coil can run during a given time period. 
A schedule value of 0 indicates that the DX Water Heating coil is off for that time period. If the schedule's value is \textgreater{} 0 (usually 1 is used), 
the coil is On duing that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Schedule values must be \textgreater{}= 0 and \textless{}= 1.

```


## Engineering Reference ##

As needed.


## Example File and Transition Changes ##

An example file will be modified to demonstrate the use of availability schedule. Simulation results will be examined and sample results will be provided.

Transition is required and transition rules will be created.

## Design ##


### Module Clean up ###

*(1) Cleanup the module and do CPP Check *

```
    a. VariableSpeedCoils
    b. WaterToAirHeatPump
    c. WaterToAirHeatPumpSimple
    d. DXCoils {if budget allows}
```

### Get Input ###

(1) * Modify the get input function to JSON format when possible *

```
    a. GetVarSpeedCoilInput()
    b. GetWatertoAirHPInput() 
    c. GetSimpleWatertoAirHPInput()
    d. GetDXCoils()  {if budget allows}
```

*(2) Update IDD and adjust the min-fields count *
*(3) Add the new input field for each DX Coil *
*    - Add "avail_schedule" member variable for each module as needed * 


### Modify Calculate Functions ###

*(1) Implement the availability schedule functionality in calc function for each DX coil: *
*(2) Functions impacted by the logics of availability schedule control:

```
    a. CalcVarSpeedCoilCooling()
    b. CalcVarSpeedCoilHeating()
    c. CalcVarSpeedHPWH()
    d. CalcHPCoolingSimple()
    e. CalcHPHeatingSimple()
    f. CalcWatertoAirHPCooling()
    g. CalcWatertoAirHPHeating()
	h. CalcHPWHDXCoil()  {if budget allows}
```


    * (2.1) Modify the calc code that truns the DX coils On or Off based on schedule value. See sample psuedo code below: *
	
	```
         if (state.dataVariableSpeedCoils->VarSpeedCoil(DXCoilNum).avail_schedule =< 0 ) {
        ... (2.1.1) skip all the DX coil calculation steps 
	    ... (2.1.2) re-set the associated report variables
         } 
    ```
