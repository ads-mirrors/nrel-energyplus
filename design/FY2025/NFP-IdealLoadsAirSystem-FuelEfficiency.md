## Justification for New Feature ##

Ideal loads air systems are increasingly used for early-stage design analysis and in a building energy code compliance method. 
However, currently this object has no built-in method for converting the loads to energy consumption. 
As a result, users have to post-process simulation results to convert the loads to energy. 

**- This enhancement is intended to support loads conversion into energy consumption for ideal loads air system object **
**- Also reduces the burden of simulation results post processing and increase the usability of the object **

## Overview ##

(1) ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem reports zone loads but not the equivalent energy consumption.
(2) This object needs a method for converting loads into energy consumptions. 
(3) It doesn't have input fields for specifying fuel efficiency values.


## Approach ##

The following two alternative approaches have been proposed for consideration to achieve the intended goal:

These two options will be discussed and the full NFP will be drafted after the initial discussion.

** Option I: Adding EMS Actuators **
Adds EMS actuator for heating and cooling fuel efficiencies to the ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem object. 

 * - Requires adding two actuators: *
 * - (1) EMS actuator “Heating Fuel Efficiency” for heating *
 * - (2) EMS actuator “Cooling Fuel Efficiency” for cooling *

These actuators pass the efficiency values and give access to the conversion method to calculate the energy consumption during runtime.

** Option II: Adding New INput Fields **
Add optional heating and cooling fuel efficiency input fields to the ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem object. 
The cooling and heating efficiency values will be used to calculate the energy consumed from the zone's ideal loads.

 * - Requires adding two new input fields: *
 * - (1) New Input Field: “Heating Fuel Efficiency Schedule Name” for heating *
 * - (2) New Input Field: “Cooling Fuel Efficiency Schedule Name” for cooling *

For both options, the heating and cooling energy rate and energy consumption will be calculated from the corresponding loads and fuel efficiencies as follows:

	 {E_dot_{heat}} = {Q_dot_{load,heat}} / {Fuel_Eff_{heat}}
	 {E_dot_{cool}} = {Q_dot_{load,cool}} / {Fuel_Eff_{cool}}
	 
	 where,
	 {Q_{dot,cool}}     = Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Rate, [W]
	 {Q_{dot,heat}}     = Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Heating Rate, [W]
	 {E_dot_{cool}}     = Zone Ideal Loads Zone Cooling Fuel Energy Rate, [W]
	 {E_dot_{heat}}     = Zone Ideal Loads Zone Heating Fuel Energy Rate, [W]
	 {E_{cool}}         = Zone Ideal Loads Zone Cooling Fuel Energy, [J]
	 {E_{heat}}         = Zone Ideal Loads Zone Heating Fuel Energy, [J]	 
	 {Fuel_Eff_{cool}}  = Cooling Fuel Efficiency, [-]
	 {Fuel_Eff_{heat}}  = Heating Fuel Efficiency, [-]
	 
### Questions for Discussion:

* (1) Which alternative approach is preferred? *

*     - Option II requires transition while option I does not *
*     - Option II does not require transition if the new fields are appended as an optional fields * 

* (2) The efficiencies apply to the total (sensible and latent components) heating and cooling loads *

* (3) Existing reporting variables will not change *

* (4) Adds the following new report variables: *

      * - Zone Ideal Loads Zone Cooling Fuel Energy Rate [W] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Zone Cooling Fuel Energy [J] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Zone Heating Fuel Energy Rate [W] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Zone Heating Fuel Energy [J] *

* (5) Consider adding the following new report variables: *

      * - Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Heating Fuel Energy Rate [W] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Heating Fuel Energy [J] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Cooling Fuel Energy Rate [W] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Cooling Fuel Energy [J] *

      * - these four new variables will also be derived from the corresponding the following report variables by applying the fuel efficiencies *

      * - Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Heating Rate [W] *
      * - Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Rate [W] *

* (6) What should be the maximum limit for the fuel efficiency value, or no maximum limit?
	  
## Testing/Validation/Data Source(s): ##

Demonstrate that the fuel efficiency input fields set to 1.0 duplicates the current results. Unit tests will be added to demonstrate the enhancement.
