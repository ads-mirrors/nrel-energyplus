Big news!  As of EnergyPLus 25.1.0, the classic IDF Version Updater tool is being deprecated.

A brand-new version updater tool has been developed, and is now packaged up on all platforms.
This new tool was written in Python, and leverages the Python interpreter embedded inside
EnergyPlus.  If you'd like to give it a try, just click the VersionUpdater shortcut in the
EnergyPlus installation root folder (one folder up), or launch from the start menu (if
you installed start menu shortcuts).

*Linux note*: if you try to launch the VersionUpdater program from the default files app, it
may launch in a text editor (since it is a shell script). Just right click and ask to "Run as a Program".

The classic version updater is included with this version, but will be removed in the future.
