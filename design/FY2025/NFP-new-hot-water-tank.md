## Justification for New Feature ##

Currently, EnergyPlus does not have a direct or explicit way to model passive
hot water tanks , which stores hot water in a way that naturally maintains
temperature stratification without the use of active mixing or heating elements
(see Figure 1). Users have used the heat pump water heater, WaterHeater:Mixed
and WaterHeater:Stratified with tricks and limitations. This hinders the ability
of users to model complex thermal energy storage systems.

Key drawbacks of the existing tank object include,
- Ambiguity in Control: Due to the dual purpose of the water heater and water
  storage tank, it is sometimes unclear whether the setpoint temperature
  controls the source side flow request or the internal heater operation.
- Fixed Flow Direction: In complex HVAC systems, such as the Time Independent
  Energy Recovery (TIER) system defined in [1] defined in , the water flow
  direction may change. For example, in the heating mode, water flows in at the
  bottom and exits at the top of the tank, whereas in the cooling mode, water
  flows in at the top and exits at the bottom. The current object has fixed
  inlet and outlet water heights, thereby only allowing a fixed flow direction.
  In contrast, the water storage tank implemented in Modelica is more flexible
  [2], with the flow direction indicated by the sign of the flow. Additionally,
  temperature sensors can be placed in all layers (at different heights) of the
  stratified tank, providing information for more complex control logic.
- Simplified Charging Logic: The current object determines tank charges (source
  side requesting water flow) based on a temperature setpoint (default) or a
  temperature upper limit (storage tank mode). However, more complex charging
  control is sometimes needed. For example, in some applications, the charging
  percentage needs to be a function of the tank temperature, which could involve
  temperature of all stratified layers. The current object does not allow for
  such complex charging percentage calculations nor does it permit control of
  this parameter via EMS or Python plug-ins.
- **Issue with autosizing**: Tank autosizing capability is present but with
  multiple issues (issue 8412, 8451, 9956). Actuators might need to be added to
  enable auto-sizing with external code (EMS or python API), especially for
  complex systems with heat pumps, heat recovery chillers, and thermal storage
  tanks.

The proposed new feature will introduce a passive hot water tank, similar to the
chilled water tank, but designed to hold hot water. It will also include various
actuators to control flow direction and tank charging. The autosizing
functionality will be thoroughly tested to ensure it functions properly. This
new tank can be incorporated into complex energy recovery systems like the TIER
system. Note that the tank will charge and discharge via direct fluid change,
unlike the ice or PCM tanks via heat exchanger coils.


## Overview ##

### EnergyPlus existing tank objects ###

There are six types of thermal storage objects available for ice, chilled water,
and hot water. Additionally, a new object (ThermalStorage:PCM) is currently
under development. Hot water storage is modeled using the WaterHeater:Mixed or
WaterHeater:Stratified objects by setting the heater capacity to zero. This
approach unnecessarily complicates the storage tank, adding 20 more fields
compared to the chilled water storage tanks (Table 1, Table 2).

Table 1. Thermal storage objects in EnergyPlus

|object|Media| \# fields| Volume autosizable |
|----|----|----|----|
|ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple | ice | 5 | No|
| ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed | Ice | 15 | No|
| ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed | Chilled water | 22 | No|
| ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified | Chilled water | 43 | No|
| WaterHeater:Mixed | Hot water | 42 | Yes|
| WaterHeater:Stratified | Hot water | 67 | Yes|

Table 2. Comparison of input and output fields of the hot and water stratified tank
<img src="hotWaterTank_Table 2.png" alt="awhp-figure-1" width="800px">

Table 3 and Table 4 compares the input and output fields among the
ThermalStorage:* objects. The chilled water stratified tank has inputs in most
input categories except for the charging related ones, where the ice storage
tank has more information. The new hot water tank will include some charging
curve fields in the input fields as well some outputs related to the charging
fraction. This enhancement can facilitate a better model of more complex tank
charging/discharging control.

The ThermalStorage:* object all have the Plant Component ThermalStorage:* on/off
supervisory actuator that can switch on/off the flow of the tank object (as well
as items on the same branch). The ThermalStorage:Ice:* objects have additionally
the following actuators related to the inlet/outlet node setpoints.

### Actuators ###

The following list of actuators will be added to allow for more complex controls.

- Charging percent: specifies how full the tank is charged. It can be a function
  of all temperature nodes in the stratified tank. If this is defined, then the
  tank control is based on this quantity rather than the temperature at the
  sensor specified in "Temperature Sensor Height"
- Node k temperature: the temperature at the kth stratified node. "k" ranges
  from 1 to the number of nodes.
- Sizing-related actuators
    - Peak load or load profile
    - Charging and discharge rate (source and use side flow rate)
    - Ambient temperature
    - Desired temperature range
